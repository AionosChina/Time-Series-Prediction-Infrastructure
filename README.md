## Dependencies

## Local Setup

## Features:
* Upload your own time-series data as a .csv file
* Upload and add external regressors (errors) to your input data `(COMING SOON)`
* Test your time series data with basic statistical tests
* Use advanced statistical tests for your algorithms such as cross-validation `(COMING SOON)`
* Predict your time series data and check the model based on residuals
* Download a full report of your findings `(COMING SOON)`

## Status
The project is _in progress_ and will be expanded with new features soon.
My goal is it to build a state of the art "Prediction Tool" application template that anyone can customize or expand at will.
